#The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :
#0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....
a,b=0,1                         #variable declaration
while b<50:                   #value of b is less than 50
    print(b)                       #print the value of b
    a,b=b,a+b                   #formla of fibonacci series


    #output =  1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
